Longest Consecutive Run
A consecutive-run is a list of adjacent, consecutive integers. This list can be either increasing or decreasing. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the length of the longest consecutive-run.

To illustrate:

longestRun([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) ➞ 5
# Two consecutive runs: [1, 2, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (longest).
Examples
longest_run([1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 15]) ➞ 3
# Longest consecutive-run: [1, 2, 3].

longest_run([5, 4, 2, 1]) ➞ 2
# Longest consecutive-run: [5, 4] and [2, 1].

longest_run([3, 5, 7, 10, 15]) ➞ 1
# No consecutive runs, so we return 1.
Notes
If there aren't any consecutive runs (there is a gap between each integer), return 1.



def longest_run(lst):
	B=sorted(lst)
	count=0
	C=[]
	for i in range(len(B)-1):
		if B[i]==B[i+1]:
			pass
		elif B[i]==B[i+1]-1:
			count+=1
			C.append(count)
		else:
			count=0
			C.append(0)
	return max(C)+1
