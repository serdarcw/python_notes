The Museum of Incredibly DULL Things
A museum wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Katya, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and removes the one with the lowest rating. Just as she finishes rating the exhibitions, she's called off to an important meeting. She asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after the lowest one is removed.

Create a function that takes a list of integers and removes the smallest value.

Examples
remove_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ) ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5]

remove_smallest([5, 3, 2, 1, 4]) ➞ [5, 3, 2, 4]

remove_smallest([2, 2, 1, 2, 1]) ➞ [2, 2, 2, 1]
Notes
Don't change the order of the left over items.
If you get an empty list, return an empty list: [] ➞ [].
If there are multiple items with the same value, remove item with lower index (3rd example).

def remove_smallest(lst):
	if lst==[]: return []
	else: lst.remove(min(lst)); return lst

def remove_smallest(lst):
  if lst:
  	lst.remove(min(lst))
  return lst

def remove_smallest(lst):
  if lst != []:
  	lst.remove(min(lst))
  return lst


def remove_smallest(lst):
	if lst!=[]:
		lst.remove(min(lst))
		return lst
	else:
		return []
